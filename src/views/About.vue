        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Titanium was created with the aim of bringing smart and
            efficient technology within the reach of everyone in the country. We are a diverse team of
            designers, engineers and technicians working together to build products tailored for use by local
            population. Harnessing the power of latest digital innovations, we believe we can change the way we
            live. We are rethinking how technology can be applied to improve daily life of people in Bangladesh.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are innovating continuously to make technology more useful and affordable. To reduce costs we
            have taken some brave steps such as establishing an assembly unit locally and optimizing the
            production process.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bringing our products within reach of everyone is part of our two-step plan. First, making the
            products as affordable as possible. Second, building an e-commerce platform with easy payment
            options and quick delivery throughout the country.
            <br>
            <br>

            We believe that achieving lower costs does not have to result in compromised quality, hence we
            implement strict Quality Assurance checks at several stages of the production. Our products include
            Intelligent Water Pump Controller, Motor Protector, Voltage Stabilizer, LED lamps, etc.
            <br>
            <br>

            We have a broader vision of contributing towards self-sufficiency of the country through localising
            production of all raw materials in the country. This will additionally help us cut back overhead and
            provide more affordable products and services to the people.</p>
